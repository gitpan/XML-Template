- Should cache files to "home" directory?

- If you change xml-template.conf, changes might not be reflected in other
cached scripts since they have values obtained from the older config file
hardcoded in.  Need to rethink how to use info from config vars.  Example:
User.pm: get_source sourcename.

- how to deal with reusing objects in nested variable tags?

- How to handle conflicting cache entries across sources?  Is this an 
isssue?

- potential sql trojan horses in url's?

Apache
  - Load config, sources, parsers on startup.
  - what else?

  - Test multiple keys.
  - Add 'tablename.' to field names in fields attrib.
  - Support delete multiple entries?
