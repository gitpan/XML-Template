- Cache XML::XPath objects for XPath vars.
- siteadmin configuration
- Use XPath vars for config.

- Add $var to subroutines param lists.

- If you change xml-template.conf, changes might not be reflected in other
cached scripts since they have values obtained from the older config file
hardcoded in.  Need to rethink how to use info from config vars.  Example:
User.pm: get_source


- Email -> Mail

- how to deal with reusing objects in nested variable tags?

x 1.  Obtain domain name syrme.net.
  2.  Register XML::Template with CPAN.
x 3.  Set up CVS on sourceforge.
  4.  Set up other sourceforge stuff.
  5.  Work on syrme.net website.
  6.  Work on syrme.net/xml-template website.
  7.  Work on XML::Template.
  8.  Create distribution and upload to CPAN.

- How to handle conflicting cache entries across sources?  Is this an 
isssue?

- potential sql trojan horses in url's?

Apache
  - Load config, sources, parsers on startup.

  - Add tablename. to field names in fields attrib.

Condition
  - work on switch
